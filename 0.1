Would like to preface this by saying there's no good reason for anyone to read what I write here. 
You'll find nothing more than my lonely, self-loathing, unappreciative and delusional perspective of existence.
/
I've felt alone for a long time and I've always done everything I could to combat facing that loneliness.
My default mask is a mismanaged construction of women and drugs, with a whole lot of lying added to the mix.
The Lies were where I learned to hide early on in my life.
It's easy to find solace in a facade. 
What I've learned is that it's just as easy to lose yourself in that facade.
Before you know it you're somewhere you never expected to be, surrounded by people you never expected to know.
You find yourself questioning whether or not you belong, and whether or not you even want to belong - constantly. And you constantly fail to find a conclusion.
The only recurring conclusion I end up at, and fail to accept, is that deep down the truth is the longer the lies are maintained the farther you get from who you really are.
The constant confliction of internal isolation, fear and anxiety with the external assumption of success, happiness and security.
It's easy to project a facade people love.
It's impossible to love yourself while maintaing the facade.
And eventually that internal conflict, the insecurity and inability to accept yourself, results in losing yourself entirely.
Worse than losing yourself - eventually, inevitability, you end up losing the people that you love.
